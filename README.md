### Requirements

- Login Screen
- Register Screen
- Home Screen (Auth)
- You must use styled-components
- You must use a state library (feel free to decide what to use)
- You must create at least one automated test (feel free to decide what to use)

Make sure to use best practices when setting up your project. Things like eslint and prettier are well seen.

### Plus

- Use typescript
- Work on the UI to make it look **_pixel-perfect_** with the design for **_iPhone 8_** (or your browser of preference simulating the mobile phone)
- Make the authentication work with JWT (You can use Firebase or any public JSON API)
- Animations
- Semantic Git commits

### Are you finished?

After you finish your test, upload the source code to Github in a private repository and contact your test applier.

Good luck!
